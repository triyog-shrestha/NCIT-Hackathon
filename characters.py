# characters.py
#
# Each entry is a dict keyed by a short, unique character id (used in URLs
# and session state, so keep it lowercase/underscored and stable once set).
#
# Fields:
#   name     (required) — display name shown on the card and chat header.
#   prompt   (required) — system prompt / persona description passed to
#                          model_chat.Character. Not read by app.py directly.
#   image    (optional) — URL or local/static path Streamlit can resolve.
#                          Used as the card's banner image. If omitted, the
#                          card shows a flat tinted banner instead.
#   avatar   (optional) — URL or path for the small circular avatar that
#                          overlaps the banner. Falls back to `image`, then
#                          to an initial-letter circle if neither is set.
#   tagline  (optional) — one short line shown on the card. Falls back to
#                          "Tap to start a conversation" if omitted.
